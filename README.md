# Reconfiguring Angular's Router with a CMS

## About

This is a presentation I gave at the Angular Portland Meetup at Alchemy Code Lab on 2018-08-16 on a technique for using an Angular frontend with a WordPress backend, relying on WordPress' built-in routing instead of re-implementing it in Angular. 

Subject matter includes:

- What routing is, conceptually
- Overview of routing in Angular
- Overview of routing in WordPress
- Benefits of keeping content out of your Angular build
- Challenge of routing to content that isn't bulded with a Single Page App 
- A method of re-configuring the Angular router on-the-fly to include outside content, using WordPress' routing

## Install and Run

This uses [Reveal.js](). After downloading, do `npm run build` to fetch Reveal.js' dependencies and build it, then **public/index.html** should load correctly in your browser.

## Notes

Non-visible notes are included inline in some slides. Reveal.js will display these in a separate window in presenter mode â€” see Reveal's docs for setting this up.
